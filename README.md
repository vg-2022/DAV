1. Given below is a dictionary having two keys ‘Boys’ and ‘Girls’ and having two lists of heights of five Boys and
Five Girls respectively as values associated with these keys
Original dictionary of lists:
{'Boys': [72, 68, 70, 69, 74], 'Girls': [63, 65, 69, 62, 61]}
From the given dictionary of lists create the following list of dictionaries:
[{'Boys': 72, 'Girls': 63}, {'Boys': 68, 'Girls': 65}, {'Boys': 70, 'Girls': 69}, {'Boys': 69, 'Girls': 62}, {‘Boys’:74,
‘Girls’:61]
2. Write programs in Python using NumPy library to do the following:
a. Compute the mean, standard deviation, and variance of a two dimensional random integer array
along the second axis.
b. Get the indices of the sorted elements of a given array.
a. B = [56, 48, 22, 41, 78, 91, 24, 46, 8, 33]
c. Create a 2-dimensional array of size m x n integer elements, also print the shape, type and data
type of the array and then reshape it into nx m array, n and m are user inputs given at the run time.
d. Test whether the elements of a given array are zero, non-zero and NaN. Record the indices of
these elements in three separate arrays.
3. Create a dataframe having at least 3 columns and 50 rows to store numeric data generated using a random
function. Replace 10% of the values by null values whose index positions are generated using random function.
Do the following:
a. Identify and count missing values in a dataframe.
b. Drop the column having more than 5 null values.
c. Identify the row label having maximum of the sum of all values in a row and drop that row.
d. Sort the dataframe on the basis of the first column.
e. Remove all duplicates from the first column.
f. Find the correlation between first and second column and covariance between second and third
column.
g. Detect the outliers and remove the rows having outliers.
h. Discretize second column and create 5 bins
4. Consider two excel files having attendance of a workshop’s participants for two days. Each file has three
fields ‘Name’, ‘Time of joining’, duration (in minutes) where names are unique within a file. Note that duration
may take one of three values (30, 40, 50) only. Import the data into two dataframes and do the following:
a. Perform merging of the two dataframes to find the names of students who had attended the
workshop on both days.
b. Find names of all students who have attended workshop on either of the days.
c. Merge two data frames row-wise and find the total number of records in the data frame.
d. Merge two data frames and use two columns names and duration as multi-row indexes. Generate
descriptive statistics for this multi-index.
5. Taking Iris data, plot the following with proper legend and axis labels: (Download IRIS data from:
https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/iris or import it from sklearn.datasets)
a. Plot bar chart to show the frequency of each class label in the data.
b. Draw a scatter plot for Petal width vs sepal width.
c. Plot density distribution for feature petal length.
d. Use a pair plot to show pairwise bivariate distribution in the Iris Dataset.
6. Consider any sales training/ weather forecasting dataset
a. Compute mean of a series grouped by another series
b. Fill an intermittent time series to replace all missing dates with values of previous non-missing date.
c. Perform appropriate year-month string to dates conversion.
d. Split a dataset to group by two columns and then sort the aggregated results within the groups.
e. Split a given dataframe into groups with bin counts.
7. Consider a data frame containing data about students i.e. name, gender and passing division:
Name Birth_Month Gender Pass_Division
0 Mudit Chauhan December M III
1 Seema Chopra January F II
2 Rani Gupta March F I
3 Aditya Narayan October M I
4 Sanjeev Sahni February M II
5 Prakash Kumar December M III
6 Ritu Agarwal September F I
7 Akshay Goel August M I
8 Meeta Kulkarni July F II
9 Preeti Ahuja November F II
10 Sunil Das Gupta April M III
11 Sonali Sapre January F I
12 Rashmi Talwar June F III
13 Ashish Dubey May M II
14 Kiran Sharma February F II
15 Sameer Bansal October M I
a. Perform one hot encoding of the last two columns of categorical data using the get_dummies() function.
b. Sort this data frame on the “Birth Month” column (i.e. January to December). Hint: Convert Month to
Categorical.
8. Consider the following data frame containing a family name, gender of the family member and her/his monthly
income in each record.
a. Plot bar chart to show the frequency of each class label in the data.
b. Draw a scatter plot for Petal width vs sepal width.
c. Plot density distribution for feature petal length.
d. Use a pair plot to show pairwise bivariate distribution in the Iris Dataset.
6. Consider any sales training/ weather forecasting dataset
a. Compute mean of a series grouped by another series
b. Fill an intermittent time series to replace all missing dates with values of previous non-missing date.
c. Perform appropriate year-month string to dates conversion.
d. Split a dataset to group by two columns and then sort the aggregated results within the groups.
e. Split a given dataframe into groups with bin counts.
